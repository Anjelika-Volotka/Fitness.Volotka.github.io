				<h2>What does YOGA do?</h2>
				<img class="right" src="img/yoga_posture.png" alt="Posture de Yoga" />
				<p> Increases Flexibility – Because infrared heat penetrates the body, it allows the muscles to achieve a greater range of motion. Research has shown yoga students were able to stretch as much as three times their normal amount in the infrared environment.

Increases Circulation - Infrared heat has been shown to stimulate blood flow by opening up the body’s capillaries. This expansion has an incredible effect on the body and offers a variety of benefits. It can help lower blood pressure, oxygenate the organs, and rid the body of toxins.

Detoxification – Sweating is the body’s natural way of flushing toxins. Infrared heat vibrates water molecules within the body, ridding it of impurities through both sweat and the bloodstream.

Weight Loss – As the body heats up, its natural temperature regulation system kicks in, requiring energy and burning calories. Infrared heat also increases the metabolism between the blood and tissues.

Pain Relief – Regenerating muscles, joints, ligaments, and tissues, infrared heating is beneficial for pain relief in minor injuries and chronic pain.
